                <p>When I started teaching my kids to budget, we tried using mason jars but quickly found
                them bulky, especially for kids with many savings goals. We used an envelope system, 
                but struggled with having enough change to divide their money. I realized that the solution
                for them was the same as it had been for me: create a virtual system!</p>

                <p>Money Jars allows kids to set up as many jars as they like and organize them into 
                the basic giving/saving/spending categories that many already use. For <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/" target="_blank">YNAB</a>
                users, you can sync with your budget. Need to give kids an allowance weekly? Simply set up a scheduled
                transfer to the child's category in YNAB and the money will automatically be available for your child to
                budget the next time they visit. For non-YNAB users, money can be added manually.</p>
